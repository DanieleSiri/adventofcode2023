# Advent of code 2023
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023"></a> My implementation of the advent of code challenges in go.

<h2>Why?</h2>
I had already done advent of code in python, so this time I decided to give it a shot in go!
I find advent of code to be a very fun and challenging way to solve basic and advanced coding problems and so from time to time I come back to this when I want to improve my skills, learn new ones and just overall increasing my knowledge.

I decided to use go this time because of its easily accessible standard libraries and because I wanted to improve my skills in this specific language that I find interesting.

<h6>Side note</h6>
I know some days are incomplete or completely missing, but I plan on finishing them sometime!
